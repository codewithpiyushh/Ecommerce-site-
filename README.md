  PikNik : Your One Stop Fashion Brand
</h2>


##  Overview
PikNik is a stylish and user-friendly online shopping platform that offers a wide range of fashion and lifestyle products. From trendy menâ€™s and womenâ€™s clothing to elegant home furnishing items, PikNik provides customers with a seamless browsing and shopping experience. Users can create accounts, explore different product categories, add items to their cart, and view a personalized dashboard. With its clean design and intuitive navigation, PikNik is designed to make online shopping simple, enjoyable, and convenient for everyone.


The PikNik is built using Go, following a modular architecture for scalability. Core functionality resides in the handlers package, handling user sessions, authentication, and template rendering. Routes like IndexHandler, MenHandler, and CartHandler render HTML templates, while JWTs secure user authentication and session management. The project uses MySQL for user credential storage and bcrypt for password hashing. The main.go file initializes the server, sets up the database connection, and defines routes with CORS and JWT middleware for secure interactions.
